# Social-Network-API

## Description

In this project I was tasked with creating the back-end for a hypothetical social network API. I employed MongoDB, a NOSQL database, and the Express-connecting middleware Mongoose to implement the desired project goals. In addition, I checked the connectivity of the end points with Insomnia and demonstrated the successful connections visually with Screencastify.

The database was modeled with a User, on which lived an array of Friends - a self-referencing User list - and a Thought, which was referenced to a schema, Reaction. A single user could have many friends and many thoughts, while a single thought could have many reactions.
